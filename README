I do not like reading comments as light grey italic text on white
background. I do not like reading identifiers as
sky blue text on white background. I do not like
reading strings, constants, punctuation, whatever,
as yellow text on white background. I prefer reading
comments, identifiers, strings, constants, everything
as black text on white background.

This is why I have installed the Stylish extension to Firefox. See
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/
and http://userstyles.org/.

This is why I have written user stylesheets for use with
Stylish when I browse some websites. These user stylesheets
are stored in the present repository, so people sharing my
opinions about syntax coloring are welcome to download them.

I do not despise the programmers who wrote the coloring
tools. Their work is very useful for baby-programmers
learning a programming language, just like sidewheels are very
useful for children learning to ride bicycles.
But when you grow up, you no longer need sidewheels.
And when you become an seasoned programmer, an expert
or a guru, you no longer need syntax color. 
The main problems will be with the programmes' semantics,
not their syntax.

Beware: the user stylesheets are incomplete. It may happen
that among the programmes I have browsed, I did not encounter
such or such class. In this case, the user stylesheet need
to be updated to include this new class.

The stylesheets are published under the same terms
as Perl: GNU General Public License (GPL) or Artistic License.
